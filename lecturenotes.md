## A note about these notes
They aren't *amazing,* but they are pretty solid.
I *may* have missed a thing or two here and there, but i've tried not to miss any super important key concepts.
Also, brace yourself if you hate spelling errors. There are going to be *quite* a few (probably).

These note do not have any program flow diagrams, partly because I didn't find them useful, but mostly because it would be a pain to actually write in markdown.

One last disclaimer: I give you no guarantees that these notes are accurate, so use them at your own risk.

That said, enjoy!

### First C Program:
#### *hello.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        return 0;

### Using Euclid's algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

First, we need two values:

$$
x = 338 \\
y = 806
$$

Now, we subtract one value from the other:

$$
| x  - y | =  468
$$

Somehow, we need to find a number that can evenly divide both x and x-y

That's hard with big numbers, so instead, we make the problem smaller. 

First, we set $$$ y $$$ to be the abs difference of x and y:

$$
y = | x - y | = 468
$$

Then, We simply repeat the algorithm on $$$ x $$$ and $$$ y $$$ again!

$$
x = 338, y = 468 \\
| x  - y | =  130 = y\\
$$

And again...

$$
x = 338, y = 130 \\
| x  - y | =  208  = y \\
$$

And repeat ad-nauseum until you get $$$ | y-x | = 0 $$$

In this case, the x and y values that subtract to 0 are 26, thus we know 26 is the GCD.

Using the MOD operator makes this process go faster, as it skips numbers.
*sidenote*: The mod operator returns the remainder between a quotient of 2 int's

$$
806\ \%\ 338 = 130 \\
338\ \%\ 130 = 78 \\
130\ \%\ 78 = 52 \\
78\ \%\ 52 = 26 \\
52\ \%\ 26 = 0
$$

And, there we have it.
When using the MOD method, the GCD is the smaller number in the final MOD operation (in this case, 26).

This algorithm can be simply implemented in c as so:

----------------

####*gcd.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void) {
        int a = 806;    // Number 1
        int b = 338;    // Number 2
        int r = 0;      // Temporary storage var

        while (b!=0) {
            r = a % b;
            a = b;``
            b = r;
        }
        printf("%d\n", a);
        return 0;
    }
```

### Computer Memory

Computer memory is essentially a table of bytes
Index | Value of Byte |
----  | ------------- |
0     |   0010 0101   |
1     |   0110 1101   |
2     |   0100 1001   |
...   |               |

A single **Byte** (Binary Digit) is **8 Bits**

Place Value |128|64 |32 |16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 
------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Digit Value | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0

*Typically*, **4** bytes makes an ***int*** type

*Sidenote*: The number above would be 32 + 4 + 2 = 38~10~

Index | Byte 1    | Byte 2    | Byte 3    | Byte 4    |
----  | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
0     | 0010 0100 | 0000 0010 | 0100 0010 | 0100 0101 |
1     | 0000 0010 | 0100 1000 | 0100 0100 | 1001 1001 |
2     | 1000 1000 | 0010 0101 | 0011 0010 | 0100 0100 |
...   | 0010 0010 | 1000 1000 | 1000 1000 | 0001 0001 |

This gives every index a total of **32 Bits** with which to store info!

### Variable types in C
Following are the typical sizes for variables in C:
 Type                   | Bits     | Bytes   | Value Range
 ---------------------- | -------- | ------- | -----------------------------------
 char                   | 8        | 1       | [-128, +127] i.e [-2^7^, +2^7^ - 1]
 int                    | 32       | 4       | [-2^31^, +2^31^ - 1]
 unsigned char          | 8        | 1       | [0, +255]
 short int              | 16       | 2       | [-2^15^, 2^15^ - 1]
 unsigned short int     | 16       | 2       | [0, +2^16^ - 1]
 unsigned int           | 32       | 4       | [0, +2^32^ - 1]
 long int               | 32 or 64 | 4 or 8  |
 long long int          | 64       | 8       | [-2^63^, +2^63^ - 1]
 unsigned long long int | 64       | 8       | [0, +2^64^ - 1]

### Unsigned integers
An **8 bit** number has the following memory layout:
Place Value | 2^7^ | 2^6^ | 2^5^ | 2^4^ | 2^3^ | 2^2^ | 2^1^ | 2^0^ |
------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
Digit Value | b~7~ | b~6~ | b~5~ | b~4~ | b~3~ | b~2~ | b~1~ | b~0~ |

The value of this byte in binary would be $$$ b_7 \cdot 2^7 + b_6 \cdot 2^6 + ... + b_0 \cdot 2^0 $$$

***Examples***:
 * 0000 0000~2~ = 0~10~
 * 0101 0101~2~ = 1+4+16+64 = 85~10~
 * 1111 1111~2~ = 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128 = 255~10~

**Unsigned integers** use all 8 bits of their memory to store a value, as opposed to **Signed integers**, that only use the last 7 bits of their memory to store a value.

### Signed integers
Negative values are represented with **two's complement** of their absolute value's binary representation.

In two's complement, the leftmost bit is the **signing bit**, and the remaining bits are used to store the value of the number.

If the signing bit is **0**, the number is **positive**.
If the signing bit is **1**, the number is **negative**.

But how do we actaully convert a negative number in Base 10 into a signed integer stored in Base 2? We follow these steps:
1. start with the unsigned binary
2. complement each bit
3. add 1

***Example***:
How do we represent -38~10~ in binary?

First, we take it's absolute value, and represent it in Binary:
$$
    38_{10} \\
    \Downarrow\\
    0010\ 0110_2\\
$$
Then, we turn each 1 into a zero, and each 0 into a 1
$$
	0010\ 0110\\
    \Downarrow\\
    1101\ 1001
$$
We now have **1's compliment**, which is useless except to later get **2's complement.**

To get 2's compliment, we add 1 to 1's compliment:
$$
    1101\ 1001_2 + 1 = 1101\ 1010_2
$$
Thus, we see that $$$ -38_{10} $$$ can be expressed as $$$ 1101\ 1010_2 $$$

### Expressions in C
Let $$$ a = 806 $$$ and $$$ b = 338 $$$

 Function | Operator | Example
----------|----------|---------
 add      | +        | a + b = 1144
 subtract | -        | a - b = 468
 multiply | *        | a * b = 272428
 divide   | /        | a / b = 2 ( NOT 2.385 ) -- Ints truncate
 modulus  | %        | a % b = 130 ( remainder )

### Order of Evaluation
C follows the basic elementary school rules of **BEDMAS**
C evaluates (in order): brackets, exponents, division, multiplication, adding, subtracting

so,that means that: `a / b + a * b` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ `(a / b) + (a * b)`

## Lecture 4
Sept 21st

### Book-keeping
**Quiz 0** will be on Friday, at the start of class. It will be about **order of operations**
Eg:
```cpp
	a = 1;
    b = 2;
    c = 3;

    printf("%d\n", a - b * c);
```
***Output:*** -5

**Assignment 1** will be released **tomorow**, and will be due in a **week**.

### Assignment
let $$$ a = 806 $$$ and $$$ b = 338 $$$
Take the following code sample:
```cpp
	a = a + b; // 1144
    b = a / b; // 3
    b = b + 1  // 4
```

An interesting thing about the assinment operator: It has a return value!
`c = a = a + b` would set c to 1144, as `a = a + b` returns `a + b`!

### Compund Assignment
We can rewrite `a = a + 2` as `a += 2`
Similarly, for all other operations:
```cpp
	a += 2;
    a -= 2;
    a *= 2;
    a /= 2;
    a %= 2;
```

### Increment and Decrement
We can shorten `a += 1` down even further by rewriting it as either:
1. `++a`	pre-increment (evaluated **before** the rest of the expression)
2. `a++`	post-increment (evaluated **after** the rest of the expression)

Similarly, `a -= 1` can be rewritten as either `a--` or `--a`;

Example of how pre and post decrement matter:
let $$$ a = 806, b = 338 $$$
```cpp
	a += ++b; // a = 1145, b = 339
    a += b++  // a = 1144, b = 2299
    a += --b  // a = 1143, b = 337
    a += b--  // a = 1144, b = 337
```

### Operator Table
For a full table, refer to **Table 4.2**, on **Page 63** of the Textbook
Appendix **A** has a complete table also.

 Precedence | Operator              | Associativity
 ---------- | --------------------- | -------------
 1          | ++, - - (post)        | left
 2          | ++, - - (pre)         | right
            | +, - (unary*)         | right
 3          | *, /, %               | left
 4          | +, - (binary\*\*)     | left
 5          | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= | right

\* **Unary** is when you do stuff like `a = -a`;
\*\* **Binary** is when you do stuff like `a = a + b`

Examples:
* Left associativity
	- `i - j - k` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ `(i - j) - k`
	- `i * j / k` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ `(i * j) / k`
* Right associativity
	- `a = b = c` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ ` a = (b = c)`
* Combined example:
	- `3 * b - ++c` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ `(3 * b) - (++c)`

### Logical Expressions
C, being a stupid, old language, lacks dedicated **boolean variables**.
In C: 
**0** evaluates as **False**
**Non-0** evaluates as **True** (Usually 1)

There are also:
* **Relational Operators:** `<, >, <=, >=`
* **Equality Operators:** `==, !=`
* **Logical Operators:** `!, &&, ||`
	- `||` and `&&` use **short circuited** evaluation, i.e: they always evaluate the left operand, and only evaluate the right operand if necesary.
		* for `&&`: if the **left** is **false**, the **right** is **not evaluated**
		* for `||`: if the **left** is **true**, the **right** is **not evaluated**

	- Examples:
    ```cpp
        (100 > 700) || (2 >= 7)  // is True,  both ops were evaled
        (100 > 700) && (2 >= 7)  // is False, only the left op was evaled
        !(100 > 700) && (2 >= 7) // is False, both ops were evaled
    ```

The relational, equality, and logical operators return **1** if **True**, and **0** if **False**

 `(i >= j) + (i == j)` | relation
 --------------------- | --------
 0                     | `i > j`
 1                     | `i < j`
 2                     | `i == j`

These operators have their own precedence table:
 operator   | precedence            | associativity
 ---------- | --------------------- | -------------
 !          | same as unary +,-     | right
 relational | lower than arithmetic | left
 equality   | lower than relational | left
 logical    | lower than equality   | left

Example: `i + j < k || ~k == 1` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ `((i+j) < k) || ((!k) == 1)`

## Lecture 5
Sept. 22nd

### Combined Operator Table
 precedence | operator              | associativity
 ---------- | --------------------- | -------------
 1          | ++, -- (post)         | left
 2          | ++, -- (pre)          | right
            | +, - (unary)          | 
            | !, ~                  | 
 3          | *, /, %               | left
 4          | +, - (binary)         | left
 5          | <, <=, >, >=          | left
 6          | =, !=                 | left
 7          | &                     | left
 8          | ^                     | left
 9          | &#124;                | left
 10         | &&                    | left
 11         | &#124; &#124;         | left
 12         | ? :                   | right
 13         | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= | right
            | ~=, &=, ^=, &#124;=   | 

### Bitwise operators
let $$$ a = 2_{10}, b = 3_{10} $$$
thus $$$ a = 0000\ 0101_{2}, b = 0000\ 0011_{2} $$$

The bitwise operators do the following:
 Operator | Description | Example
 -------- | ----------- | -------
 ~        | NOT         |`c = ~a` $$$ \Longrightarrow c = 1111\ 1010 $$$
 &        | AND         |`c = a & b` $$$ \Longrightarrow c = 0000\ 0001 $$$
 ^        | XOR         |`c = a ^ b` $$$ \Longrightarrow c = 0000\ 0110 $$$
 &#124;   | OR          |`c = a`  &#124; `b` $$$ \Longrightarrow c = 0000\ 0111 $$$

### DeMorgan's Theourem
DeMorgan's Theourem states that
$$
	!(P\ \&\&\ Q)\ ==\ !P\ ||\ !Q \\
    !(P\ ||\ Q)\ ==\ !P\ \&\&\ !Q
$$

**Proof:**

 P | Q | P && Q | !(P && Q)
 - | - | ------ | ---------
 0 | 0 | 0      | 1
 0 | 1 | 0      | 1
 1 | 0 | 0      | 1
 1 | 1 | 1      | 0

 !P | !Q | !P &#124;&#124; !Q 
 -  | -  | -------------------
 1  | 1  | 1
 1  | 0  | 1
 0  | 1  | 1
 0  | 0  | 0

Example of Application:
` !( i >= 0 && i < n) ` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ ` ~(i >= 0) || !(i < n) ` $$$ \Longleftrightarrow $$$ `i < 0 || i >= n`

### Selection Statements
In C, there are 2 types of selection statements:
1. if / else
2. switch

We'll simply discuss if / else, read about switch yourself.

If statements come in two forms:

**Single If**
```cpp
	if (expresson)
    	statement
```

**If / Else**
```cpp
	if (expresson)
    	statement
    else
    	statement
```

One can have **nested ifs**, but one must remember that if writing code without brackets, else will always match with the **nearest unmatched if**, ***regardless of indentation.***
Example:
```cpp
	int 0 = 3;
    if (i % 2 == 0)
    	if (i == 0)
        	printf("zero\n");
    else
    	printf("how odd\n");
```
This code actually prints **nothing!** If you add brackets, you see why:
```cpp
	int 0 = 3;
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
    	if (i == 0) {
        	printf("zero\n");
        } else {
            printf("how odd\n");
        }
    }
```

Another interesting thing to note: *C doesn't have an "else if" keyword!*
How does C handle else if statements?
The following example explains:
```cpp
	// Without Brackets vs With Brackets
    
	if (expr)           // if (expr) {
    	// blah         //     // blah
    else if (expr)      // } else {
    	// blah         //     if (expr) {
    else                //         //blah
        // blah         //     } else {
    	                //         // blah
                        //     }
                        // }
```

### Compound statements
**Brace Brackets** make one statement from 0, 1, 2, 3, ... expressions
Example:
```cpp
	if ( i == 0 )
    	printf("zero\n");
    else {
    	printf("even\n");
        printf("or\n");
        printf("odd\n");
    }
```

### Conditional expression
C has this neat expresson: `? :`
It is used in the following way. ` (condition) ? {if true} : {if false} `
Essentially, it is a condensed if statement.

Example:
```cpp
	if (i > j)
    	printf("%d\n", i);
    else
    	printf("%d\n", j);
```
Can be condensed into simply `printf("%d\n", i > j ? i : j )`

### Boolean Values
C origionally did not have boolean values.
True was 1, False was 0.

In the C99 Specification, they added boolean values.

They are used as such:
```cpp
	#include <stdbool.h>
    
    int main (void) {
    	bool first = true;
        
        for (;;) {
            if (true)
                first = false;
            else
                printf("Boop")
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

## Lecture 6
Sept 25th

### While Loop
While loops execute **0 or more** times
Example of a While loop:
```cpp
	int r = a % b;
    while (r != 0) {
    	a = b;
        b = r;
        r = a % b;
    }
```

### Do While Loop
Do While loops execute **1 or more** times
Example of a Do While loop:
```cpp
	do {
    	r = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = r;
    } while (r != 0);
```

### Functions
We can rewrite GCD as a function:
```cpp
	int gcd (int a, int b){
    	int r = a % b;
        while (r != 0) {
        	a = b;
            b = r;
            r = a % b;
        }
        return b;
    }
```

If we define this function in a program, we can then write something like this:
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    int gcd (int a, int b){
    	int r = a % b;
        while (r != 0) {
        	a = b;
            b = r;
            r = a % b;
        }
        return b;
    }

    int main (void) {
    	printf("%d\n", gcd(806, 338));  // prints out 26
        printf("%d\n", gcd(15, 27));    // prints out 3
        return 0;
    }
```
- **int** before gcd is the **return type** of the function
- **int a** and **int b** are called the **parameters** of the function
- **806** and **338** are called the **arguments** passed to the function
- This entire code block is called a **function definition**

***NOTE:*** To use a function, you **MUST** declare it **before** it is invoked!

### Assertions
Assertions can be inplemented by including the `assert.h` header library, and by calling `assert(exp)` somewhere in a program.

If `expr` evaluates to **true**, nothing happens.
If `expr` evaluates to **false**, it terminates the program with a message stating:
* the filename
* line number
* function name and expression

Evidently, `assert` is supremely useful for debugging.

Here is an example relevant to A2_02
```cpp
	#include <assert.h>
    ...
    bool leap(int year) {
    	assert(year >= 1753);
        if (year % 400 == 0) {
        ...etc
    }
```
Asserts can be left in a program even when pushing code in production, and in fact, they should!
- Programmers make assumptions when programming and then forget about them
- Assertions cause a program to fail "loudly" when these assumptions are broken, rather than failing "softly" (continuing to execute regardless of error)
- Asserts protect against future modifications that insert logic errors into the program

### Seperate Compilation
What if we want to compile a program from multiple files?

Say we have 2 c files that depend on one another:

#### *powers.c*
```cpp
	/* Defines the functions */
    int square(int num) { return num * num; }
    int cube(int num) { return square(num) * num; }
    int quartic(int num) { return square(num) * square(num); }
	int quintic(int num) { return cube(num) * square(num); }
```
***Notice the lack of main!***

#### *main.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    /* Below we declare:
         1) That these functions exist
         2) The return type of these functions
         3) The parameter types of the functions
    */
    int quartic(int num); // does not have to have the same
    int quintic(int num); // parameter name as in powers.c

    void testQuartic (int num) { printf("%d^4 = %d\n", num, quartic(num)); }
    void testQuintic (int num) { printf("%d^5 = %d\n", num, quintic(num)); }

    int main() {
    	testQuartic(3);
        testQuintic(2);
    }
```
To compile the two source files together, we have to run a modified `gcc` command:
`gcc -o powers main.c powers.c` (order of source files should not matter)

### Header Files
Header files declare functions (and a whole bunch of other stuff that we don't care about right now.)

For example, the `powers` program above could be rewritten to use a header file
#### powers.h
```cpp
	#ifndef POWERS_H  // For if we accidentally include a duplicate header file
        #define POWERS_H
        int square(int num);
        int cube(int num);
        int quartic(int num);
        int quintic(int num);
    #endif
```

#### powers.c
```cpp
	*** Stays the same ***
```

#### main.c
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>
    #include "powers.h"

    ... stays the same ...
```
Using a header does not change the compiler arguments, so to compile the two source files together, we still just run: `gcc -o powers main.c powers.c`

### Recursion
Recursion is having a function call itself.

For example, let's rewrite gcd.c recursively:

####*gcdr.c*
```cpp
	int gcd(int a, int b) {
    	if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
```
Dayum. Ain't that short!

### Pass by Value
Take the following code:
```cpp
	void weird (int n) {
    	n = 17;
    }
    
    void main () {
    	int n = 6;
        weird(n);
        printf("%d\n", n);
    }
```
What do you think it outputs?
It's not `17`! It's actually `6`!

This is because all that weird did was make a locally scoped variable and set it's value. Just because the two variables had the same name, does not mean that one changes the value of the other!

### Arrays
This is a scalar: `int a = 6;`
`6` is the initalializer for the array.

In memory, it looks like this:
 var | val
 --- | ---
 a   | 6

This is an array: `int a[5] = {10, -7, 3, 8, 42};`
`10, -7, 3, 8, 42` are all initializers for a.

In memory, it looks like this:
 var | val
 --- | ---
 a   | 10
     | -7
     | 3
     | 8
     | 42

Size can be set either:
**explicitly**: `int a[5] = {10, -7, 3, 8, 42};`
**implicitly**: `int a[] = {10, -7, 3, 8, 42};`

When defining **implicitly**, C sets the size of the array to the number of elements it was initialized with.

If defining **explicitly**, but only **defining a few of the values**, C fills the rest of the array with 0's
Eg: `int b[5] = {1,2,3} == {1,2,3,0,0};`
Eg: `int c[5] = {0} == {0,0,0,0,0};`

If you don't initialize an array with values, it will still be allocated in memory, but referencing the array will yield garbage...
Eg: `int d[5]; == {?,?,?,?,?}`

Arrays are **0 indexed**.
When referencing an element of an array, C counts the first element as element 0
Eg: `a[3] = {1,2,3}; printf("%d\n", a[2]);` outputs **3**

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes finds all primes up to a number n (some upper bound)

Eg: Given n=20, the function returns 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19

The alogorithm works by starting with 2, marking it as prime, and then crossing out all multiples of 2. Once it gets to the upper bound, it goes on to the next non-corssed out number (3), and crosses out all of it's multiples. It continues to do this until it hits a number $$$ \leq \sqrt{n} $$$

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes_animation.gif">

An implementation in C follows:
####*sieve.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>
    void sieve(int a[], int n) {
        // a[] is variable sized, so we must also
        // pass n, the size of the array

        if (n <= 0) return; // empty array
        a[0] = 0;
        if (n == 1) return; // just 1
        a[1] = 0;
        if (n == 2) return; // just 1 and 2

        // set the rest of the numbers to 1
        // as they may be prime
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) a[i] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= (n-1)/i; i++) {
            if (a[i]) {
                for (int j = 2*i; j < n; j += i) {
                    a[j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    void main () {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);
        int a[n+1];
        sieve(a, n+1);

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (a[i]) printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
```

### Sizeof Operator
`sizeof(type)` Returns the size of the **type** in bytes
`sizeof(var)` Returns the size of the **variable** in bytes
It is usually implemented at runtime (so variable length arrays don't play nicely with it)

Take the following example:
```cpp
	void strange(int a[], int n) {     // a is JUST A POINTER!
    	printf("%d\n", sizeof(a));     // Either 8 (or 4)
        							   // Depends of size of pointer implement
    }
    void main() {
    	int i;
        int a[10] = {0};

        printf("%d\n", sizeof(int));   // 4
        printf("%d\n", sizeof(i));     // 4
    	printf("%d\n", sizeof(char));  // 1
        printf("%d\n", sizeof(a));     // 40 ---- this is a known size arr

        int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]); // gives length of arr, 
        								// even if variable length
        stange(a, n);

        int m; scanf("%d", &n); // INPUT 8
        int b[n];
        printf("%d\n", sizeof(b)); //32
    }
```

### Array Pointers
Look at this code:
```cpp
	int a[5] = {0,1,2,3,4};
    printf("%lu\n", (unsigned long)a); // Prints "140737326347974"
```
What the hell is that thing?!

It's a **pointer** to the first item in the array in memory!

Because `a` is just a pointer, we can rewrite functions that take arrays using **pointer notation**, i.e:
`void foo (int a[], int n)` can be rewritten as `void food (int *a, int n)`

Keep in mind that even though you *can* use pointer notations, you *probably shouldn't*, as pointer notation usually obfuscates the nature of the function for those who have to look at it.

Weird things happen when assigning arrays to other variables:
```cpp
	void main () {
    	int a[] = {0,1,2,3,4};
        int *b = a;

        printf("%d\n", a[2]);  // prints 2
        b[2] = 100;
        printf("%d\n", a[2]);  // prints 100
    }
```
a and b point to the **same** memory adress, so any edits to one affect the other.

### Multidimensional arrays
Arrays within Arrays within Arrays, Oh my!
```cpp
	int a[4][3] = {
    	{11,12,13},
        {21,22,23},
        {31,32,33},
        {41,42,43}
     };

     printf("%d\n", a[1][2]); // 23

    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            sum += a[i][j];
        }
    }

     printf("%d\n", sum);
```

A little caveats of multidimensional arrays:
When defining a function that takes a multidemensional array, one **must** specify **all but the first dimension**!
eg: `int sum(int a[][3][4], int n)` is valid
eg: `int sum(int a[][][4], int n, int m)` is **NOT** valid

### Floating Point Numbers
C stores floating points using Scientific Notation (eg: $$$-2.6302 * 10^{30}$$$)
The memory used in such a number is divided between the **precision** of the number (-2.6302), and the **range** of the number (30).

There are a few different types of floating point numbers:
type        | storage  | precision  | range
----------- | -------  | ---------- | -------
float       | 4 bytes  | ~7 digits  | +- 38
double      | 8 bytes  | ~16 digits | +-308
long double | 16 bytes | ~31 digits | +-4931

Look at the following code for an example of how to use floats:
```cpp
	float z = 1.0f    // use float as type, and f to cast number as float
    double y = 1.0;   // not always neccessary to cast number when assigning

    void main () {
    	double x = -2.6302e30; // yet another way to define floats

        printf("%d\n", sizeof(x)) // 8 [bytes];
        printf("%f\n", x)' // -26302 000 000 000 00 123 564 578 345 000 000

        // there is gibberish in the number due to
        // binary being unable to perfectly represent
        // some decimal numbers

        printf("%.2e\n", x); // -2.63e+30
        // The .2 truncates the float, and e prints it in scientific notation

        printf("%g\n", x); // -2.6302e+30
        // %g prints out whatever is shorter between %e and %f (int this case %g)
    }
```

## Lecture 12

### The IEEE 754 Floating Point Standard
Double Precision numbers are 64 bits, with the following layout:
* Bit 63: Sign (1 is negative, 0 is positive)
* Bits 62-52: Exponent
* Bits 51-0: Fraction

Eg: +1.1e2^1 = `0|100 000 000 000|10000...`

Floating points are only *approximations* of real numbers.
Eg: $$$ 0.1_{10} $$$ cannot be represented perfectly in binary. It's binary representation is $$$ 0.0001111..._{2} $$$

### Representaion Error
Let **r** be a **real number**
Let **p** be the **approcimated value**

The **absolute error** is $$$ | p - r | $$$
eg: $$$ |3.14 - \pi| \approx 0.0015927 $$$

The **relative error** is $$$ \frac{|p-r|}{|r|} $$$
eg: $$$ \frac{|3.14-\pi|}{|\pi|} \approx 0.000507 $$$

Relative error can be very large if r is small.
Thus, care is required when:

a) subtracting nearly equal numbers
b) dividing by very small numbers
c) multiplying by very large numbers
d) tests for equality

Example of riskyness:
```cpp
	double x = 5.0/6.0;
    double y = 1.0/2.0;
    double z = 1.0/3.0;

    if (x-y == z) printf("equal\n");
    else printf("not equal\n");

    // Prints 'not equal'
```

Smarter to rewrite it as:
```cpp
	#define EPSILON 0.00001

    // can use fabs() instead of || below
	if (x - y - z < EPSILON || x-y-z > -EPSILON) printf("equal\n");
    else printf("not equal\n");

    // Prints 'equal'
```

### Polynomials
You can represent polynomials as an array of coefficients.
Ex: $$$f(x) = 3x^3 +4x^2+6$$$ can be represented as  `double f[] = {3,4,0,6}`

Evaluating the polynomial is also pretty easy:

####*poly.c*

```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <assert.h>

    double eval_p(double f[], int n, double x) {
        assert(n > 0);

        double y = f[0];
        double p = 1.0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            p *= x;
            y += f[i]*p;
        }

        return y;
    }

    int main () {
        double f[] = {2,9,4,3};
        printf("%f\n", eval_p(f, 4, 2));

        return 0;
    }
```
This is the intuitive implementation.
There are:
- 2(n-1) **float multplies**
- n-1 **float additions**

Not bad... but there is a more efficient method!
It is called **Horner's Method**

### Horner's Method
A polynomial such as
$$ f(x) = 3x^3+4x^2+9x+2 $$
Can be rewritten as
$$ f(x) = 2+x(9+x(4+3x)) $$

We can leverage this fact to make a more efficient algorithm:
#### *poly_h.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <assert.h>

    double horner(double f[], int n, double x) {
        assert(n > 0);

        double y = f[n-1];

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            y = x*y + f[i];
        }

        return y;
    }

    int main () {
        double f[] = {2,9,4,3};
        printf("%f\n", horner(f, 4, 2));

        return 0;
    }
```

This implementation only has:
- n-1 **float multplies**
- n-1 **float additions**

Dat efficiency doe.

### Math.h Highlights
```cpp
	#include <math.h>

    // Trig
    double sin  (double x); // sine
    	   cos            // cosine
           tan            // tangent
           asin           // sin-1
           acos           // cos-1
           ...            // etc

    // Exponents
    double exp   (double x);           // e^x
    	   log                      // ln x
           log10                    // log x 
           sqrt                     // squrt
           pow   (double x, double y)  // x^y

    // Misc.
    double ceil  (double x);
           floor
           fabs

    // Constants
        M_PI      // pi
        M_PI_2    // pi/2
        M_E       // e
        M_LN2     // ln(2)
        M_SQRT2   // sqrt(2)
        NAN       // not-a-number
        INFINITY  // Guess.
```

### The Bisection Algorithm
We can approximate the roots of a function using the Bisection Algorithm.

Refer to MATH 117 Notes for details on the algorithm.

As a refresher, the algorithm is as follows:

1) Start with some $$$ a $$$ and $$$ b $$$ where $$$ f(a) < 0 $$$ and $$$ f(b) > 0 $$$
2) Compute the midpoint $$$ m = (a+b)/2 $$$
3) if $$$ f(m) < 0 $$$ then $$$ a = m $$$, else $$$ b = m $$$
4) GOTO 2 as many times as one likes for precision

Note: This algorithm only works accurately when there is only **one** root between a and b.

Obviously, we can rewrite this algorithm in C:
This program caluclates the root of the function $$$ f(x) = x - cos(x) $$$
#### *bisect.c*
```cpp
	#include <assert.h>
    #include <math.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    double f(double x) {
        return x-cos(x);
    }

    double bisect(double a, double b, double epsilon, int max_iter) {
        assert(f(a) * f(b) < 0 && epsilon > 0);
        double m, fm;
        for (int i = 0; i < max_iter; i++) {
            m = (a+b)/2;
            fm = f(m);
            if (fabs(fm) <= epsilon) return m;


            if (f(a)*fm < 0)
                b = m; 
            else 
                a = m;
        }
        return m;
    }

    int main(void) {
        printf("%g\n", bisect(-10, +10, 0.001, 100000));
        return 0;
    }
```

How can we calculate the number of iterations it took to calculate x?
- we start with $$$ \frac{b-a}{2} $$$
- each iteration reduces the distance by half
- Thus, using math...
$$
	\epsilon = \frac{b-a}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} ... (x\ times) \\
    \epsilon = \frac{b-a}{2} \cdot 2^{-x} \\
    2^x = \frac{b-a}{2\epsilon} \\
    log(2^x) = log(\frac{b-a}{2\epsilon}) \\
    x = \frac{log(\frac{b-a}{2\epsilon})}{log(2)}
$$

In our example above, $$$ x \approx 13 $$$

### Fixed-Point Iteration
FPI is yet another root finding method

Given $$$ f(x) = x - cos(x) $$$, we want $$$ x_0 $$$ such that $$$ f(x_0) = 0 $$$
$$
    x - cos(x) = 0 \\
	g(x) = cos(x)
$$

We start with a rough guess...
$$
	x_{n+1} = g(x_n)
$$
And we repeat until $$$ |x_{n+1} - x{n}|< \epsilon $$$

Note: ** THIS DOES NOT ALWAYS CONVERGE. **

In C, this function is written as:

#### *fixed.c*
```cpp
	#include <assert.h>
    #include <math.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    double g(double x) {
    	return cos(x);
    }

    double fixed(double guess, double epsilon, int max_iters) {
    	for (int i = 0; i < max_iters; i++) {
        	double gx = g(guess);
            if (fabs(gx-guess) < epsilon) return gx;
            guess = gx;
        }
        return guess;
    }

    int main(void) {
    	printf("%g\n", fixed(0, 0.001, 100000));
        return 0;
    }
```

### Function Pointers
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions!

So, if we want to pass a function like `double f(double x)` as a parameter, we would use the form `double (*f)(double)`

Eg:
```cpp
	double f(double x) { return x; }
	double eval_func(double x, double (*h)(double)) { return h(x); }
```

We can use this property to generalize `bisect()` to work with any function:

```cpp
	double f0(double x) { return x*x-3; }
    double f1(double x) { return cos(x) - x; }

    void main () {
    	printf("%g\n", bisect(-10, +10, 0.001, 100000, f0));
        printf("%g\n", bisect(-10, +10, 0.001, 100000, f1));
    }
```

### Structures
Structures (structs) are **compound data types**.
They group several named member variables** together in memory**, so that they can all be accessed using just one name (pointer).

A simple example would be a struct that holds the time of day (in 24h time):
```cpp
	struct tod {
    	int hours;
        int minutes;
    };
```

Here is how one would actually use that struct in a program:
```cpp
	void main() {
    	struct tod now = {16,50}; // or {.hours = 16, .minutes = 50};
        struct tod later;

        later.hours = 18;
        later.minutes = 0;

        printf("%d:%d\n", now.hours, now.minutes);        // 16:50
        printf("%d:%02d\n", later.hours, later.minutes);  // 18:00
    }
```

We can also use structs as parameters:
```cpp
	void todPrint(struct tod when) {
    	printf("%02d:%02d\n", when.hours, when.minutes);
    }

    void main() {
    	struct tod later {18,0};
        todPrint(later);
    }
```

Can we return structs? Hell yeah we can!
```cpp
	struct tod todAddTime(struct tod when, int hours, int minutes) {
    	when.minutes += minutes;
        when.hours += hours + when.minutes / 60;

        when.minutes %= 60;
        when.hours %= 24;

        return when;
    }

    void main() {
    	struct tod now = {16, 50};
        now = todAddTime(now, 1, 10);
        todPrint(now);
    }
```

We can simplify declaring structs using **typedefs**:
```cpp
	typedef struct {
    	int hours;
        int minutes;
    } tod;

    void main() {
    	tod now = {16, 50};
        ...
    }
```

### Designated Initializers
Sidenote: When defining a structure, you can specify fields to initialize by name, and any unnamed fields are set to 0.

eg: `tod later = {.minutes = 60}` makes `tod={0,60}`
eg: `int a[6] = {[4]=1, [1]=2}` makes `{0,2,0,0,1,0}`

### Complex Numbers
Before programming with complex numbers, we must first understand what complex numbers actually are.
Complex Numbers are numbers that have the following format:
$$
	x + yi
$$
Where $$$ i=\sqrt{-1} $$$ or  $$$ i^2 = -1 $$$.

As youcan see, complex numbers consist of two components:
- $$$ x $$$ is the **real** component.
- $$$ yi $$$ is the **imaginary** component

Here are the various operations we can do with complex numbers:
- Addition: $$$ (x+yi) + (w + zi) = (x + w) + (y+z)i $$$
- Multiplication: $$$ (x+yi)(w + zi) = (xw - yz) + (xz + yw)i $$$

### Complex Numbers in C89
While C99 added a complex numbers library, C89 does not have one, so programmers had to write their own implementation.
Let's write our own implementation. Why? Because.

#### *cplex.h*
```cpp
	#ifndef CPLEX.H
    #define CPLEX.H

        // Define the Complex Number struct
        typedef struct {
        	double r;
            double i;
        } cplex;

        // Declare functions to work with cplex structs
        cplex cplexConstruct(double r, double i);
        cplex cplexAdd(cplex a, cplex b);
        cplex cplexMult(cplex a, cplex b);
        void cplexPrint(cplex a);

    #endif
```

#### *cplex.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>

    #include "cplex.h"

    cplex cplexConstruct(double r, double i) {
        return (cplex) {.r = r, .i = i};
    }
    void cplexPrint (cplex a) {
        printf("%g + %gi\n", a.r, a.i);
    }

    cplex cplexAdd(cplex a, cplex b) {
        return (cplex) {
            .r = a.r + b.r,
            .i = a.i + b.i
        };
    }
    cplex cplexMult(cplex a, cplex b) {
        return (cplex) {
            .r = a.r * b.r - a.i * b.i,
            .i = a.r * b.i + a.i * b.r
        };
    }
```

#### *cplexMain.c*
```cpp
	#include "cplex.h"

    int main () {
        cplex a = cplexConstruct(1,2);
        cplex b = cplexConstruct(3,4);

        cplex c = cplexAdd(a,b);

        cplexPrint(c);

        c = cplexMult(a,b);

        cplexPrint(c);

        return 0;
    }
```

Ah, another important note:
`if (a == b)` is **NOT** a valid way to check equality between two structs!

### Complex Numbers in C99+
**TL;DR**: It's better.

#### *cplexMain.c*
```cpp
	#include <complex.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    void main () {
    	double complex a = 1 + 2*I;
        double complex b = 3 + 4*I;

        double complex c = a + b;

		printf("%g + %gi\n", creal(c), cimag(c));

        c = a * b;

        printf("%g + %gi\n", creal(c), cimag(c));

        return 0;
    }
```

### Pagerank
How does Google figure out what you're looking for?
Well, they use a variety of variables:
* content of webpages (anchor text mainly)
* user behavior
* webpage rank (which is static)

That last one is what we want to focus on.

**Pagerank** is a *static* list of webpages.
It is sorted by how "good" the website is.

The rank of a website, i.e: how "good" it is, is determined by how many other websites link to the webpage (logic being that a good website would be reffered to my many other websites).

How does Google build this Pagerank listing?

They might use the **Random Surfer Model**.
This is how it works:
* pretend you are surfing randomly
* at each step, you either:
	* follow a link (probability $$$ \delta $$$) OR
	* Jump to a random page (probability $$$ 1-\delta $$$)
* The Pagerank of a page Q, R(Q), is the probability that you are on page Q after surfing for a long time.

R(Q) is calculated accoring to the following formula:
$$
	R(Q) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} + \delta\sum\limits_{P \rightarrow Q} \frac{R(P)}{out(P)}
$$
Where: 
* $$$ N $$$ is the Total Number of Pages.
* $$$ \sum\limits_{P \rightarrow Q} $$$ is the sum of all pages pointing to Q
* $$$ R(P) $$$ Pagerank of page linking to Q
* $$$ out(P) $$$ Pagerank of page linked from Q

Let's take an example of a simple web:
* X links to Y and Z, and is linked to by Y
* Y links to X, and is linked to by Y and Z
* Z links to Y, and is linked to by X

$$$
	R(X) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} + \delta \frac{R(Y)}{1}\\
    R(Y) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} + \delta (\frac{R(X)}{2} + R(Z))\\
    R(Z) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} + \delta \frac{R(X)}{2}
$$$

If $$$ \delta = 80\% = \frac{4}{5} $$$ Thus $$$ \frac{1-\delta}{N} = \frac{1}{15} $$$

We can then solve a system of **linear equations** to find X, Y, and Z.
But I'm not going to solve those by hand, no, that would be too easy...

Let's use our old friend **fixed-point iteration!**

* Let our **initial guess** be that $$$ x = y = z = 0.333... $$$
	* new $$$ x = \frac{1}{15} +  \frac{4}{5}(y=0.333...) $$$
	* new $$$ y = \frac{1}{15} +  \frac{2}{5}(x=0.333...) + \frac{4}{5}(z=0.333...) $$$
	* new $$$ z = \frac{1}{15} +  \frac{2}{5}(x=0.333...) $$$
* Repeat ad-nauseum intill we get a good answer.

After 20 iterations: $$$ x = 0.383, y = 0.396, z = 0.220 $$$

For the whole web, this would take *thousands* of iterations.

Sidenote: FPI doesn't always converege, but it usually does, so that's good.

## Lecture 18
Oct 30th

### Caveats of FPI in computing pagerank
Take an example of the following web:
* X link to Y and Z
* Y links to Z, and is linked to by X
* Z is linked to by X and Y

Note that Z is a **sink**, i.e: it does not link to any pages at all

Writing out the equations for pagerank results in the following:
$$$
	\delta = \frac{4}{5}\\
	R(X) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} = \frac{1}{15}\\
    R(Y) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} + \delta \frac{R(X)}{out(X)} = \frac{1}{15}+\frac{4}{5}\frac{R(X)}{2}\\
    R(Z) = \frac{1-\delta}{N} + \delta \frac{R(X)}{out(X)} + \delta \frac{R(Y)}{out(Y)} = \frac{1}{15}+\frac{4}{5}\frac{R(X)}{2} + \frac{4R(Y)}{5}\\
$$$

This is problematic as it "removes" probability from the web.

### Representing the Web as an Arary of Structs
Let's define the web as used in Lecture 17 Part 1 in C.

First, we define a struct for each link:
```cpp
	typedef struct {
    	int src, dst;
    } link;
```

Now, we can make an Array of Links to represent the web:
```cpp
	link l[] = {
    	{0,1}, {0,2},   // page X
        {1,0},          // page Y
        {2,1}           // page Z
    }
```

Lets write a program to solve the system of equations!

#### *pagerank.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    typedef struct {
        int src, dst;
    } link;

    // it may not be super efficient with loops
    // but it's readable and comprehensible
    void pagerank (link l[], int n_link, double r[], int n_page, double delta, int n_iter){
        double s[n_page];   // holds a temp copy of the new ranks
        int out[n_page];    // out(P)

        for (int i = 0; i < n_page; i++) out[i] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n_link; j++) out[l[j].src]++;

        // initial guess
        for (int i = 0; i < n_page; i++) r[i] = 1.0 / n_page;

        // fixed-point iteration implementation
        for (int k = 0; k < n_iter; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n_page; i++) s[i] = (1.0 - delta) / n_page;
            for (int j = 0; j < n_link; j++) 
            	s[l[j].dst] += (r[l[j].src]/out[l[j].src])*delta;

            //copy s to r
            for (int i = 0; i < n_page; i++) r[i] = s[i]; 
        }
    }

    void main () {
        link l[] = {{0,1},{0,2},{1,0},{2,1}};
        double r[3];
        pagerank(l, sizeof(l)/sizeof(l[0]), r, 3, 0.80, 20);
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) printf("%g\n", r[i]);
    }
```

Do note that for the real WWW, n_iter is probably going to be in the 100's to 1000's.

### Pointers
What the hell is a pointer?

Well, it's a variable that "points" to location in memory that has a certain data type.
But that's technical mumbo jumbo, what does it actually mean?

When we write `int i = 6;`, we tell C to allocate a 8 bit chunk of memory to store the value of 6, and to label that location in memory with the variable i.
So, when we then write `i = 4`, C knows what memory location i reffers to, and changes the value in that memory block to 4.

Now, what if we write `int *p;`
The hell is that asterisk doing there?
Well, this asterisk specifies that the variable being declared is a special type of variable, a **pointer**
The variable p does not itself contain an integer, but instead, it contains the location of a memory adress where an integer resides.
Initially, `p` does not point to any specific location, and accesing it without setting a pointee is very dangerous.

Say we want to tell `*p` to point to `i`'s location in memory.
We write `p = &i`, where `&` **references** i, that is, it returns not the value at I, but `i`'s actual memory adress.

Now that `p` points to the memory location of i, we can use `*p = 10` to chnge the value of `i` to `10`! That `*` **derefrences** the memory location that `p` contains.

That's the gist of it, let's see an example:
```cpp
	int i = 6;
    int *p;

    p = &i;
    *p = 10;

    printf("%d \n", i);  // 10

    int *q;
    q = p;
    *q = 17;

    printf("%d \n", i);  // 17
```
Notice that multiple pointers can point to the same adress in memory!

Alright, that's neat and all, but why are pointers *useful*?

Well, if you pass pointers to a function, that function is able to modify variables **outside of it's scope!**

Take the following example:

#### *swap.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    void swap(int *p, int *q) {  // takes memory locations and derefs them
    	int temp = *p;
        *p = *q;
        *q = temp;
    }

    void main () {
    	int i = 0; j = 2;
        swap(&i, &j);            // passing the memory locaiton of i and j
        printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
    }
```

SIDENOTE: There is a one line version of swap put forth by our resident genius:
`if (x!=y) *x = *x ^ *y ^ (*y = *x);`
How does this work? Good question. XOR's apparently. I dunno, I just wrote it down.

Alright, what else can pointers be used for?
Well, we can have functions that return pointers.
Here is an example:

#### *largest.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    int *largest(int a[], int n) {
    	int m = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        	if (a[i]>a[m]) m = i;
        }
        return a + m;   // or return &(a[m]);
    }

	void main () {
    	int test[] = {0,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,0};
        int *p = largest(test, sizeof(test)/sizeof(test[0]));
        printf("%d\n", test[*p]);
    }
```
You might be wondering, what the hell is `return a + m`? Well, it's an example of...

### Pointer arithmentic
There are a few different arithmetic operations we can preform on pointers:
* We can add an `int` to a pointer
* We can subtract and `int` from a pointer
* We can subtract pointers from one another (so long as they are the same type)

Example:
```cpp
	int a[8] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    int *p, *p, *q, i;

    p = &(a[2]); // p points to a[2]
    q = p + 3;   // q points to a[5]
    p += 3;      // p points to a[5]
    p = q - 3    // p points to a[2]
    i = q - p;   // i = 3
    i = p - q;   // i = -3
```

We can also compare pointers using all the usual relational operators `>` `<` `==`, etc.

Here is an example that heavily employs pointer arithmetic:
#### *sumarray.c*
```cpp
	int sum (int a[], int n) {
    	int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++)  // OR: for (int *p = a; p < a + n; p++)
        	total += *(a + i);        //         total += *p; 
        return total;
    }
```
Neat.

Now, here's something to challenge your brain a bit...

### ksplice pointer challenge
What does this code print out?
(assuming x points to memadress 100, and an int is length 4)
```cpp
	$include <stdio.h>
    void main() {
    	int x[5];
        printf("%p\n" x);       // 100
        printf("%p\n" x + 1);   // 104
        printf("%p\n" &x);      // 100 (because apparently x == &x)
        printf("%p\n" &x + 1);  // 120 (because int (*x)[5] + 1)
    }
```

## Lecture 20

### Characters
C stores characters in `char` variables, 1 byte signed integers.
C uses the **ASCII** system for converting between these integers and characters.

ASCII is:
* A 7-bit code for repeating characters
* 0000000-1111111 Means that an ASCII char has 128 possible values
* ASCII is divided into a few char "groups"
	* 00 - 31: Control Characters
	* 48 - 57: digits '0' to '9'
	* 65 - 90: letters 'A' to 'Z'
	* 97 - 122: letters 'a' - 'z'

*NOTE*: A full ASCII table is available in a multitude of places online

In C, we can represent characters as their integer counterparts by enclosing the char in single appostrophes.

Here is a sample piece of code to show off some properties of chars:
```cpp
	char c = 'a'     // 97
    c = 65           // 'A'
    c += 2           // 'C'
    c += 32          // 'c'
    c = '\n'         // newline char
    c = '\0'         // null character
```

Now, ASCII worked fine when all computers had to represent was English, but as time went on, and the world became globalized,the world needed a system that would support *all* the characters out there from *all* languages, so that anyone could communicate with everyone. That's why we now have...

### Unicode
Unicode assigns "codepoints" to over *100000 characters* from many languages (both living and dead, even pretend!).
A unicode character spans 21 bits, and has a range [0, 2^21^ - 1], or 3 bytes per character.

Eg: The mandarin character 'sun' has the unicode `26085`~10~ or `U+65E5` in Hex

An awesome thing about Unicode is that it shares data values with ASCII!
Unicode 'a' is `97`~10~ = `U+0061` = `110 0001`~2~, which is the same as ASCII

The unicode spec jsut defines the *codes* for each characters, there are still different ways to actually *encode* unicode.
Popular specs include: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS-2

But by far the most popular and best supported one is UTF-8

### UTF-8 - Unicode Transformation Format
UTF-8 is a **Variable Length** unicode representation, and is also **backwards compatible** with traditional ASCII

- 1-byte characters, i.e: codepoints 0-127, are ASCII chars
- 2-byte characters are up to 11 bits long, with a range [128, 2^11^ - 1 (i.e 2047)]
- 3-byte characters are up to 16 bits long, with a range [2048, 2^16^ - 1 (i.e 65535)]
- 4-byte characters are up to 21 bits long, with a range [65536, 2^21^ - 1 (i.e: 2097151)]
Bits | Codepoint                  | UTF-8
---- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------
 1   | `XXX XXXX`                 | `0XXX XXX`
 2   | `XXXXX YYYYYY`             | `110XXXXX 10YYYYYY`
 3   | `XXXX YYYYYY ZZZZZZ`       | `1110XXX 10YYYYYY 10XXXXXX`
 4   | `XXX YYYYYY ZZZZZZ WWWWWW` | `11110XXX 10YYYYYY 10ZZZZZZ 10WWWWWW`

Eg. That 'sun' character from before with code `26085`~10~ has the 3 bit UTF-8 encoding 
`1110 0110 10 010111 10 100101`

### Unicode in C
Starting with C99, C has a standard library for working with Unicode.
`#include <wchar.h>` is what you have to use.
You can read up about it on the internet, / on textbook page 650

**NOTE:** In this course, we will be using ASCII for everything. Unicode is just good to know!

Now, for something completely different:

### More about Pointers
Pointers can be **Null pointers**, or a pointer to nothing.
We can make a null pointer by casting 0 to a pointer like so: `(void*)0`
So, to make a `int*` null pointer, we do `int *p = (int*)0;`
It works similarly, for doubles and structs.

**NOTE:** The cast is actually optional! `int *p = 0;` is also valid!

### Dynamic Storage
To use any of the following functions, you must `#include <stdlib.h>`.

stdlib.h defines the following function: `void *malloc(size_t size)`
`malloc` returns a pointer to a block of *size* bytes of memory

`void free(void *p)` is `malloc`'s inverse.
`free` releases the memory allocated by `malloc`
**NOT FREEING MEMORY WILL LEAD TO MEMORY LEAKS, WHICH ARE BAD**

How are these functions useful?
Well, let's look at an example:
```cpp
	#include <stdlib.h>
    int *numbers(int n) {
    	int *p = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof (int));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        	p[i] = i + 1;
        return p;
    }
```
This little function returns a pointer to an array filled with a range of numbers [0,n]

## Lecture 21
Nov 6th

### Dynamic Storage Continued
Let's actually call `numbers()` from a main:
```cpp
	void main () {
    	int *q = numbers(100);
        printf("%d\n", q[50]); // Outputs 51
        free(q);
    }
```

### Strings
How does C handle strings?
Well, simply put, a string in C is just an **array of `char`s** that is **terminated by a null character ('\0')**.

We can define strings in a few ways:
1) `char s[] = "hello";`
2) `char s[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'};`
3) `char *s = "hello";`

Each of these is equally valid (although 2 is usually not used).

### String manipulations in C
Unlike high level languages, C has pretty bad built in string manipulation.
And by bad, I mean it doesn't have any.
If you want to modify a string in some way, you have to manually write a function that will do an operation you like (or use a library like `<string.h>`).

As an example, let's write a function that counts how many times a given character `c` occurs in a string `s`

#### *c_count.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    int count(char *s, char c) {
    	int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        	if (s[i] == c) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    //// you can also rewrite the for loop with pointers
    // for (char *p = sl *p != '\0'; p++) {
    //     if (*p == c) count++;
    // }

    void main() {
    	char *hi = "Hello world!";
        printf("%d\n",count(hi,'l')); // 3
        printf("%d\n",count(hi,'z')); // 0
        printf("%d\n",count(hi,'L')); // 0
    }
```

### string.h
`<string.h>` is a helpful C library that implements some basic string manipulation and utility functions.

Here is a list of some helpful functions from the library:
* **`size_t strlen(const char *s);`**
	* returns the string length of `s` in an unsigned long
	* does not include `'\0'`
	* `const` means that `strlen` should only read the string, not mutate it.
* **`char *strcopy(char *s0, const char *s1);`**
	* copies string `s1` into `s0`
	* returns `s0`
	* `s0` must have enough room to store the contents of `s1`
		* `strcopy` does **NOT** check that there is enough room
		* if there is not enough room, strcopy will just overwrite any bits that follow after s0
* **`char *strcat(char *s0, const char *s1);`**
	* concatenates `s1` to `s0`(adds `s1` to the end of `s0`);
	* returns `s0`
	* Again, it doesn not check there is enough room, like `strcopy`
	* Why does it return a pointer? Because one could "chain" multiple `strcat`s to concat multiple strings together in a one line expression
* **`int strcmp(const char *s0, const char *s1);`**
	* computes strings "lexicographically," i.e: comparing ASCII values
	* returns:
		* `< 0` if `s0 < s1`
		* `==0` if `s0 == s1`
		* `> 0` if `s0 > s1`
    * Example:
    	* `printf("%d\n", strcmp("abc","abC"));` returns `0 + 0 + (99-67) = 32`

Let's write a new version of `strcat` that dynamically allocates enough memory to hold the contents of `s0` and `s1`

#### *concat.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>

	char *concat(const char *s0, const char *s1) {
    	char *s = (char*)malloc((strlen(s0) + strlen(s1)) + 1);
        // fine since sizeof(char) is just 1
        // extra 1 is there for the `\0`
    	strcpy(s,s0);
        strcat(s,s1);
        return s;
    }

    void main() {
    	char *hi = concat("hello", "world");
        printf("%s\n", hi);

        free(hi);
    }
```

Now, for something completely different:

### Switch Statements
Switch statements are an alternative to if statements.
They are not as versitile, but they may improve code readability

Switch statements are comprised of a few base parts:
```cpp
	switch (expression) {  // evaluate expression
    	case expr1:        //   if expression has a value expr1...
        	statements...  //     do statements...
            break;         //     end switch
        case expr2:        //   if expression has a value expr2...
        	statements...  //     do statements...
                           //     (no break, therefore fall through to next case)
        default:           //   if none of the above
        	statements...  //     do statements...
	}

```

For example, we could write a program that prints out a standing based on a letter grade:
```cpp
	void standing(char grade) {
    	switch (grade){
        	case 'A': printf("EXCEL\n"); break;
            case 'B': printf("GOOD \n"); break;
            case 'C': printf("SAT  \n"); break;
            case 'D': printf("POOR \n"); break;
            case 'F': printf("FAIL \n"); break;
            default : printf("INVALID\n");
        }
    }
```

## Lecture 22
Nov 9th

### Switch Statements cont.
Not including a `break;` at the end of a case will result in a "fall through" to the next case.
As an example, we can write a function that takes a letter grade and prints "pass" or "fail"
```cpp
	void passFail(char grade) {
    	switch (grade) {
        	case 'A':
            case 'B':
            case 'C':
            case 'D': printf("pass\n"); break;
            case 'F': printf("fail\n"); break;
            default: printf("invalid\n");
        }
    }
```

### Dynamic Storage
What important functions does `#include <stdlib.h>` give us access to?
* **`void *malloc(size_t size);`**
	* Allocates `size` bytes of memory for use by the program
* **`void free(void *p)`**
	* Frees up the memory previously allocated by the program
* **`void *realloc(void *p, size_t size)`**
	* Given a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block (i.e: one returned by `malloc` or `calloc`), `realloc` will either expand or shrink that block of memory to size `size`
	* If there is not enough room to expand the memory block, `realloc` may allocate a new block of memory elsewhere in the memory, and copy over data from the original block
	* Returns pointer to new location of memory array (may or may not be equal to the given pointer, depends if 'realloc' allocated new memory and copied, or not)
* **`void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);`**
	* Allocates space for an array of `nmemb` elements of `size` bytes each, and initialtes all members of the array to `0`

**Note:** `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` all return `0` if they cannot allocate enough memory requested, or `size == 0`

We should check the return values of these functions to make sure they were successful by doing something like `assert(p);` when allocating to a pointer `p`

### Pointers to Structs
What happens if we want to`malloc` a memory block to hold structs?
Well, it works fine, but there is a weird syntax...
Take the following example:
```cpp
    typedef struct {
        int hour, min;
    } tod;

    tod *t = malloc(sizeof(tod));

    // to reference the elements of the tod malloc'ed array,
    // we either do:

    (*t).hour = 18;

    // but that's ugly, so the more common way is

    t->hour = 18;
```

### Better Arrays
Wouldn't it be great if C had a vector type that
* grows automatically when adding new elements?
* knows the ammount of elements it contains?
* initializes it's own elements to 0?

Yeah it would! So let's make one!

We can make a special struct that has 3 fields:
1) `a` - the array of vector elements
2) `length` - the number of vector elements in the array
3) `size` - The total number of elements that have been allocated in the array

First, let's come up with an outline for what functions we want...
#### *vectors.h*
```cpp
    #ifndef VECTOR_H
    #define VECTOR_H
        struct vector;
        typedef struct vector vector;

        vector *vectorCreate();
        vector *vectorDelete(vector *v);
        void vectorSet(vector *v, int index, int value);
        int vectorGet(vector *v, int index);
        int vectorLength(vector *v);
    #endif
```

Small note: we do not explicitly state what `struct vector` stores here in the header, and we instead declare it's structure later on in our implementation file `vector.c`.
This practice is called *opaque structs*, i.e: we make it so that the user doesn't see the details of your struct implementation in the header file.

Alright! Now, what behavior do we expect from using these functions?
#### *vector_test.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "vector.h"

    void main() {
        vector *v = vectorCreate();

        vectorSet(v, 10, 2);
        printf("%d\n", vectorLength(v));    // 11
        printf("%d\n", vectorGet(v, 10));   // 2
        v = vectorDelete(v);
    }
```

Now, let's actually implement the functions!
JKLOLNO We ran out of time. TUNE IN NEXT LECTURE FOR MORE EXCITING C IMPLEMENTATIONS!


## Lecture 23
Nov 11

Okay, here is the actual implementation:
#### *vectors.c*
```cpp
    #include <assert.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include "vector.h"

    struct vector{
        int *a;
        int length, size;
    };

    vector *vectorCreate() {
        vector *v = malloc(sizeof(vector));
            assert(v);
        v->size = 1;
        v->a = malloc(1*sizeof(int));
            assert(v->a);
        v->length = 0;
        return v;
    }

    vector *vectorDelete(vector *v) {
        if (v) {
            free(v->a);   // Free array in v
            free(v);      // Free the struct v
        }
        return 0;         // sets pointer to 0
    }

    void vectorSet(vector *v, int index, int value) {
        assert(v && index >= 0);
        // grow storage if necessary
        if (index >= v->size) {
            do {
                v->size *= 2;
            } while (index >= v->size);
            v->a = realloc(v->a, v->size * sizeof(int));
        }
        // another way to do this is to increase
        // the size of the array using
        //     v->size = 1<<ceil(log(index)/log(2));
        // but just because you can, doesn't mean you should

        // now, fill new elements with 0s
        while (index >= v->length) {
            v->a[v->length] = 0;
            v->length++;
        }
        v -> a[index] = value;
    }

    int vectorGet(vector *v, int index) {
        assert(v && index >= 0 && index < v->length);
        return v->a[index];
    }

    int vectorLength(vector *v) {
        assert(v);
        return v->length;
    }
```

### Information Hiding
Remember how we made it so that `vector`'s srtucture was not declared in the header?
This design principle is called **information hiding**

Why do we practice this notion of information hiding?
- If we hide the details of implementation from the user, yet keep the "interface" the same, we can change our implememntation without braking other people's reliant code
- If they can see your struct, they may directly reference it, and then when you change it's implementaion, their code will break.

### Big O Notation
Get ready for some Math!

Let $$$ f(x) $$$ be a function over the real numbers.
$$$ O(f(x)) $$$ is a set of functions such that:
$$$ g(x) \in O(f(x)) $$$ if and only if there exists an $$$ M>0 $$$ and $$$ x_0 $$$ such that $$$ |g(x)| \leq M|f(x)| $$$ for all $$$ x > x_0 $$$

In pure math:
$$$
	g(x) \in O(f(x)) \Longleftrightarrow \exists\ M>0, x_0\ s.t\ |g(x)|\leq M|f(x)| \ \forall\ x > x_0
$$$

For example:
$$$ 3x^2 + 2 \in O(x^2) $$$
Proof:
if $$$ x>1 $$$, then if $$$ M = 5 $$$
$$$
	|3x^2 +2 | = 3x^2 + 1 \leq 5x^2 = 5|x^2|\\
    x_0 = 1
$$$
Therefore, if $$$ x_0 = 1, M = 5 $$$
$$$ |3x^2 +2 | = M|x^2| $$$ for all $$$ x > x_0 $$$

Another example of a **Constant** function
$$$ 6sin(x) \in O(1) $$$
Proof:
if $$$ x>0, M=6 $$$, then $$$ |6sin(x)| \leq 6$$$

**Polynomials** of degree $$$ n $$$ belong to $$$ O(x^n) $$$.
Proof:
if $$$ x > 1 $$$,
$$$
	|a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+...+a_0 \\
    \leq |a_n|x^n + |a_{n-1}|x^{n-1}+...+|a_0| \\
    \leq (|a_n| + |a_{n-1}|+...+|a_0|)x^n
$$$
This holds if $$$ x_0 = 1, M = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n|a_n| $$$
As a result, if $$$ n \leq m $$$ then $$$ x^n \in O(x^m) $$$

## Lecture 24
Nov. 13

### Big O Notation Continued
More examples! Here is a **Logarithmic** function:
$$$ log_a(x) \in O(log_b(x)) $$$
Proof:
if $$$ x > 1 $$$,
$$$
	|log_a(x)| = |log_b(x)|\\
    = \frac{log_b(x)}{log_b(a)}\\
    = \frac{1}{log_b(a)}|log_b(x)|\\
$$$
Therefore, if $$$ x_0 = 1, M = \frac{1}{log_b(a)} $$$

i.e: we can ignore the base of a logarithm
- We rarely write the bse of the logarithm in Big O Notation

One last example: ** Exponential ** functions:
$$$ x^n \in O(c^x) $$$ if  $$$ n $$$ is an int, and $$$ c > 1 $$$

### Combinations of Big O's
if $$$ g_0(x) \in O(f_0(x)) $$$ and $$$ g_1(x) \in O(f_1(x)) $$$, then
i) $$$ g_0(x) + g_1(x) \in O(f_0(x)+f_1(x)) $$$
ii) $$$ g_0(x)g_1(x) \in O(f_0(x)f_1(x)) $$$

### Transitivity of Big O's
if $$$ h(x) \in O(g(x)) $$$ and $$$ g(x) \in O(f(x)) $$$, then
$$$ h(x) \in O(f(x)) $$$

### A note on convention:
$$$ g(x) \in O(f(x)) $$$
can also be written as:
$$$ g(x) $$$ is $$$ O(f(x)) $$$
$$$ g(x) = O(f(x)) $$$

### Big O Notation in CS
How is Big O Notation relevant in CS?
Well, we can use it to analyze the **efficiency of algorithms!**

Take the following Linear Search Algorithm:
It returns the index of the first occurance of a value in an array.
```cpp
	int search(int a[], int n, int value) {
    	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        	if (a[i] == value) return i;
        }
        return -1; // value not found
    }
```

What operations does this function perform?
 Order | Operation               | Time to Perform
 ----- | ----------------------- | -------------------
 1     | enter the function      | up to A
       | start the loop          |
 2     | test the loop condition | up to B **n times**
       | evaluate if expression  |
       | increment loop counter  |
 3     | return answer           | up to C

Assuming n > 0:

The **best case scenario** is that the value is *found in a[0].*
Time $$$ = A + B + C = O(1) $$$, or **constant time**.

The **worst case scenario** is that the value is *not found.*
Time $$$ = A + Bn + C = O(n) $$$, or **linear time**.

The **average case** is that the value is *located somewhere between a[0]...a[n-1]*
Time $$$ = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(a+Bi+C)\\ = A + B + \frac{B}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(i)\\ = A + C + \frac{B}{n}\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\= A + C + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2}n\\ = O(n)$$$
or **linear time**.

Usually, we are only interested in the **worst case scenario**.

### Jargon!
Sorted from leat to most complex:
 Big O            | Name
 ---------------- | ----
 $$$ O(1)     $$$ | constant time
 $$$ O(log n) $$$ | logarithmic
 $$$ O(n)     $$$ | linear
 $$$ O(n^2)  $$$ | quadratic
 $$$ O(n^3)  $$$ | cubic
 $$$ O(n^m)  $$$ | polynomial
 $$$ O(c^n)  $$$ | exponential
 $$$ O(n!)    $$$ | factorial

### Sorting
Given an array of integers, how can we sort the array in ascending order (non-descending order)?

Relevant Interesting Video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg

### Sorting - Selection Sort
- Find the smallest element
- Swap with first element
- Repeat above with the rest of the array, finding next smallest number, and swapping with next element
<img src="http://www.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Selection-sort-algorithm.jpg">

#### *selection.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    void selection_sort (int a[], int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            int min = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j<n; j++)
                if (a[j] < a[min]) min = j;

            int temp = a[min];
            a[min] = a[i];
            a[i] = temp;
        }
    }

    void main (){
        int a[] = {-10,-7,2,14,11,38};
        int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);

        selection_sort(a,n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d, ", a[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
```

This is a $$$O(n^2)$$$ algorithm. Why? Well, let's analyze it...

- Entering the function, and initializing the outer loop will take **A** Time.
- In the outer loop: 
	- Setting up the inner loop, swapping the variables, and running the inner loop takes **B * (n - 1)** Time.
	- In the inner loop:
		- finding the smallest number will take **C * (n - (i + 1))**

Thus, the total execution time will be:
$$$
	A + B(n-1) + C( (n-1)+(n-2)+(n-3)+...+1 ) \\
    = A + B(n-1) + C \sum\limits_{i=1}^n(i) \\
    = A + B(n-1) + C\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\
    = O(n^2)
$$$

### Sorting - Insertion Sort
- seperate the array into a **sorted part** and an **unsorted part**.
- for every **x** in the unsorted part, find where x should go in the sorted part.
	- shift up elements that are > x in the sorted part
	- insert x
- repeat n-1 times

<img src="http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/_images/insertionsort.png">

#### *insertion.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    void insertion_sort (int *a, int n) {
        int i, j, x;
        for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            x = a[i];
            for (j = i; j > 0 && x < a[j - 1]; j--) {
                a[j] = a[j - 1];
            }
            a[j] = x;
        }
    }

    void main (){
        int a[] = {-10,2,14,-7,11,38};
        int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);

        insertion_sort(a,n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d, ", a[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
```

This is also a $$$O(n^2)$$$ algorithm, but it *can* be $$$O(n)$$$ sometimes!

- Outer loop has n-1 interations
- Inner loop has 0 -> i iterations
- In the **worst** case:
	- time $$$ = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) = O(n^2) $$$
- In the **best** case though:
	- time $$$ = (n-1)C = O(n) $$$

### Sorting - Merge Sort
Unlike the above algorithms, merge sort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm.
It is also a *recursive* algorithm

- Divide the array in half
- Sort each half (recursively)
- Merge the results

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Merge_sort_algorithm_diagram.svg/300px-Merge_sort_algorithm_diagram.svg.png">

#### *merge.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <assert.h>

    // a is array to be sorted
    // t is temp array
    // n is size
    void merge_sort (int a[], int t[], int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return;

        // divide and sort both halves
        int middle = n / 2;
        int *lower = a;
        int *upper = a + middle;

        merge_sort(lower, t,     middle);
        merge_sort(upper, t, n - middle);

        // merge the halves:
        int i = 0;      // lower index
        int j = middle; // upper index
        int k = 0;      // temp  index

        // One half...
        while (i < middle && j < n) {
            // lower < upper
            if (a[i] <= a[j]) t[k++] = a[i++];
            // lower > upper
            else              t[k++] = a[j++];
        }

        // Other half...
        // Only one of the two loops below will
        // actually execute
        while (i < middle) t[k++] = a[i++];
        while (j < n)      t[k++] = a[j++];

        // copy from temp to a
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = t[i];

    }

    void sort(int a[], int n) {
        int *t = malloc(n*sizeof(int));
            assert(t);
        merge_sort(a, t, n);
        free(t);
    }

    void main (){
        int a[] = {-10,2,14,-7,11,38};
        int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);

        sort(a,n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d, ", a[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
```
What is the time complexity of this algorithm?
Well, it's actually $$$ O(n log(n)) $$$!
Why?

Suppose $$$ n = 2^k $$$
So, $$$ n = \{2,3,8,16...\}\ k = \{1,2,3,4...\} $$$
The size of the array is divided in half $$$ k = \log_2(n) $$$ times, and ech time it is split, $$$ n $$$ operations are done on that level.

So: $$$ O(nk) = O(n\log_2(n)) = O(n\log(n)) $$$

This is best, worst, and average all at once.

### Sorting - Quicksort - WARNING, BAD NOTES
Tony Hoare invented this alogrithm in 1959, when he was only ~26 years old!

*"If you haven't done anything worthwhile in CS before you turn 30, you probably never will"*
\- **Prof. Andrew Morton**

This is a good algorithm because you *don't have to use a temporary array!*

How does quicksort work?
- Pick an element of the array at random. We call this element **P**, the **pivot** element
- We then partition the array into 3 sections, one of all element before P, P itself, and every element after P.
- We then recursively sort each section other than P itself.

How do we actually partition? That's the critical question...

**One that these notes cannot adequately answer!**
Sorry about that.
You really need diagrams for this one...
On the bring side, Wikipedia.org exists. And Google too!

While I can't expain the algorthm, I can at least give you an implementation:
#### *quick.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <assert.h>

    // swap helper
    void swap(int *a, int *b) {
        int t = *a;
        *a = *b;
        *b = t;
    }

    void quick_sort(int a[], int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return;

        // sweep
        int m = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (a[i] < a[0]) {
                m++;
                swap(&a[m],&a[i]);
            }
        }

        // put pivot between partitions
        // i.e, swap a[0] and a[m]
        swap(&a[0],&a[m]);

        // quicksort each partition
        quick_sort(a, m);
        quick_sort(a + m + 1, n - m - 1);
    }

    void main (){
        int a[] = {-10,2,14,-7,11,38};
        int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);

        quick_sort(a,n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            printf("%d, ", a[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
```

Again, I'm not very good at explaining this one, so here is the takeaway:
This algorithm's time efficiency is:
- Best case $$$ O(n\log(n)) $$$
- On average $$$ O(n\log(n)) $$$
- Worst case (the array is already sorted) $$$ O(n^2) $$$

Despite quicksort's pretty bad worst case compared to other algorithms, in most cases, quicksort is still faster.

Also, I missed space complexity, sorry.

### Quicksort Improvements
The Hoare partitioner is one way to make quicksort more efficient.
It's uglier code, but it has better preformance.

- Pick a Pivot
- Sweep from left *AND* right
    - using i and j to index left and right respectively
- swap when a[i] > P && a[j] < P
- stop when i > j

#### *quicksort_hoare.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>

    void swap(int *a, int *b) {
        int t = *a;
        *a = *b;
        *b = t;
    }

    void quicksort(int a[], int left, int right) {
        int i = left, j = right;
        int pivot = a[left];

        while(i <= j) {
            while(a[i] < pivot) i++;
            while(a[j] > pivot) j--;
            if(i <= j) {
                swap(&a[i],&a[j]);
                i++; j--;
            }
        }

        if(left < j) quicksort(a, left, j);
        if(right > i) quicksort(a, i, right);
    }

    int main() {
        int a[] = { 2, -10, 14, 42, 11, -7, 0, 38 };

        quicksort(a, 0, sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]) - 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]); i++) {
            printf("%d, ", a[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");

        return 0;
    }
```

### The qsort Function
In `stdlib.h` there is a function called `qsort` that is defined as follows:

**`void qsort(void *base, size_t n, size_t, size, int (*compare)(const void *a, const void *b));`**

- `*base` is a pointer to the first element in the array
- `n` is the number of elements in the array
- `size` is the size of each array element in bytes
- `*compare` is a **function pointer** to some function that
	- returns `< 0` if `*a < *b`
	- returns `0` if `*a = *b`
	- returns `> 0` if `*a > *b`

Essentially, `qsort` is a heneralized sorter that can sort any structure you give if so long as you specify the type of structure you are passing it, and how to comapre structure elements.

For example, you can tell `qsort` to sort integers by doing something like this:
```cpp
	#include <stdlib.h>

	int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {
        int p = *(int *)a;
        int q = *(int *)b;
        if (p < q) return -1;
        else if (p == q) return 0;
        else return 1;
    }

    void sort(int a[], int n) {
    	qsort(a,n,sizeof(int),compare);
    }
```
And you can just call `sort()`

### Fibonacci Numbers
Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:
$$$ F_0 = 0\\ F_1 = 1,\\ F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} $$$

In C:
#### *fibonacci.c*
```cpp
    // prints 10th fibonacci number
    #include <stdio.h>

    int fib (int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
    }

    int main () {
        printf("%d\n",fib(10));
        return 0;
    }
```

Also, there is no easy way to get to this result, but the time complexity of this particular algorithm is $$$ O(2^n)$$$. Which is bad. Real bad.

A better implementation of fibonacci would be as follows (it is only $$$ O(n) $$$)
```cpp
	int fib2(int n) {
        int m = 1;
        int k = 0;
        int i;

        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int tmp = m + k;
            m = k;
            k = tmp;
        }
        return m;
    }
```
Hint. You need this for the exam.

### Measuring program runtime
Say we want to measure how long it takes to for a certain function / program to run?
In C, a simple way to implement such a measurement is to use `time.h`'s `clock()` funcion to get the "time" at the start of the thing you want to measure, and once more at the end.

NOTE: "time" is not real time usually, it's some sort of "number of ticks" since some arbitrary event.

For example, say we want to measure out `fib()` function above:
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <time.h>

    // this is implicitly defined
    // #define CLOCKS_PER_SEC 100000

    int fib (int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
    }

    int main () {
        clock_t start = clock();
        printf("%d\n", fib(37));
        clock_t end = clock();
        printf("%ld\n", (long int)(end-start)/CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
        return 0;
    }
```

### Binary Search
How can we efficiently search through a *sorted* array?

We can use a **binary search algorithm**!

- Probe the middle element
	- if a[m] > value, search left half
	- if a[m] < value, search right half
	- if a[m] == value, return m

Let's make a function `int search(int a[], int n, int value)` that will return the position of the element if it is found in the array, or -1 otherwise:

#### *binarysearch.c*
```cpp
    #include <stdio.h>

    int search(int a[], int n, int value) {
        int l = 0,
            h = n-1;

        while (h >= l) {
            int m = l+(h-l)/2; // or (h+l)>>1; becuase bitshifting
            if (a[m] == value) return m;
            if (a[m] < value) l = m+1;
            if (a[m] > value) h = m-1;
        }

        return -1;
    }

    int main() {
        int a[] = {-10,7,0,2,11,14,38,42};
        printf("%d\n", search(a,sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]),10));    // -1
        printf("%d\n", search(a,sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]),2));     // 3
        printf("%d\n", search(a,sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]),42));    // 7
        return 0;
    }
```

Evidently, the** Worst Case **time complexity is $$$ O(\log(n)) $$$ and the **Best Case** time complexity is $$$ O(1) $$$ (the midpoint is the correct element)

### Linked Lists
Recall our vector implementation, and how as the number of vectors outgrew the size of the array, the array doubled in size.
This could be inneficient for frequent insertions mid list (for sparsley used vectors).
Is there a better way of implementing an expanding array-like data structure?

Well, obviously. It's called a **linked list!**

<img src="http://www.java2novice.com/images/linked_list.png">

We will implement a linked list to hold **polynomials** (vectors are done in an upper year CS course)

So, let's say we want to store information about the polynomial **2x^3^ + 8x - 12**
We can make a `struct` with 3 properties:
1) `double` The coefficient
2) `int` The degree
3) `*poly` A pointer to the next element of the polynomial (NULL if end of the list)

#### *poly.h*
```cpp
    #ifndef POLY_H
    #define POLY_H

    typedef struct poly {
        double coeff;
        int deg;
        struct poly *next;
    } poly;

    poly   *polyCreate      ();
    poly   *polyDelete      (poly *p);
    poly   *polySetCoeff    (poly *p, int deg, double coeff);
    double  polyEval        (poly *p, double x);
    int     polyDegree      (poly *p);
    poly   *polyReverse     (poly *p);

    #endif
```

#### *main.c*
```cpp
	#include <stdio.h>

    #include "poly.h"

    int main() {
        poly *p = polyCreate();

        p = polySetCoeff(p, 3, 3.0);
        p = polySetCoeff(p, 0, 3.0);
        p = polySetCoeff(p, 1, 3.0);

        printf("%g\n", polyEval(p,-1)); // -3

        p = polyDelete(p);

        return 0;
    }
```

#### *poly.c*
```cpp
    #include <math.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    #include "poly.h"

    poly *polyCreate() {
        // init empty list
        return 0;
    }

    poly *polyDelete(poly *p) {
        while (p) {
            poly *t = p;    // set to to point to p
            p = p->next;    // set p to point to next element in ll
            free(t);        // free origional p value
        }
        return p;
    }

    // Notice that p is passes *by value*
    // so we can increment and modify p within this loop
    // to our heart's content
    double polyEval(poly *p, double x) {
        double f = 0.0;     // value of the function

        // iterate over the nodes(terms) and evaluate each appropriately
        // Note: DO NOT USE p++! 
        // Terms are (probably) not next to one another in memory
        for (; p; p = p->next)
            f += pow(x,p->deg)*p->coeff;

        return f;
    }

    poly *polySetCoeff(poly *p, int deg, double coeff) {
        // ignore requests to set coeff to 0
        if (!coeff) return p;

        // if empty list / insert at head
        if (!p || deg > p->deg) {
            poly *q = malloc(sizeof(poly));
            q->coeff = coeff;
            q->deg   = deg;
            q->next  = p;
            return q;
        }

        // find location to insert
        poly *cur = p;
        for (; cur->next && cur ->next->deg > deg; cur = cur->next);
        // this for loop brings us to the correct place

        // If we are not at the end of the list, and it is the same
        // degree as the degree we want to set the coefficient of...
        if (cur->next && cur->next->deg == deg) {
            cur->next->coeff = coeff;
        } 
        // If we are at the end of the list, or there does not exit
        // a node for the desired degree...
        else {
            poly *q = malloc(sizeof(poly));
            q->coeff = coeff;
            q->deg = deg;
            // insert into the list (order of operations matters!)
            // first, set q's next pointer to point to cur's next
            q->next = cur->next;
            // next, set cur's next point to point to q
            cur->next = q;
        }
        return p;
    }

    // calculate degree of polynomial
    int polyDegree (poly *p) {
        if (p == 0) return 0;   // behavior agreed upon beforehand
        return p->deg;          // because ll are listed automagically
    }

    // reverse a linked list
    // THIS BREAKS OTHER FUNCTIONS
    // IT'S JUST A GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
    // THEY ASK THIS ON INTERVIEWS
    poly *polyReverse(poly *p) {
        poly *q = 0; // reverse list that starts empty
        while(p) {
            // remember p->next
            poly *next = p->next;
            // insert the next node of the old list
            // into the head of the reversed list
            p->next = q;
            q = p;
            p = next;
        }
        return q;
    }

### Makefiles
Why type long commands to compile programs when you can just make a makefile, type `make` into your terminal, and boom bam alakazam, your program is compiled!

Lets make a Makefile for our poly linked list program:

#### *Makefile*
```makefile
	poly: main.c poly.c poly.h         # target: prerequisites
		gcc -o poly poly.c main.c -lm  # recipe
    clean:
    	rm -f poly
```

Here is another Makefile...
#### *Makefile*
```makefile
	# Variables
    CC = gcc
    CFLAGS = -g -std=c99                 # -g for debugging info
    LIBS = -lm

    default: poly
    cplex: cplexMain.c cplex.c cplex.h
    poly: main.c poly.c poly.h
    %:%.c
    	$(CC) $(FLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LIBS)  # $@ is target name
    PHONY: clean
    clean:
    	rm -f foly cplex
```

How does this thing work? Great question reader, one that I would love an answer to!
This is just what Morty wrote verbatim

### Random sidenote!
There is a little difference between the following two lines:
```cpp
    const char *c;
    char * const c;
```

Line one states that we cannot modify **the value** that the pointer `c` points to.
Line two states that we cannot modify **the actual pointer** `c`.

# That's it. Good luck on the final.
Hope these notes helped :D
